                    Hello, I'm a professional electronic engineer. Throughout my professional journey, I have been dedicated to providing the best customer experience. Managing services, solving problems, and understanding the needs of each consumer have been my focus. That's why I aim to bridge the two realms of programming and service to others. <br>Currently, I am pursuing a postgraduate degree in Mobile App Development at George Brown College - Toronto. My goal is to create a unique experience that translates a brilliant idea into reality and share it with others through mobile technology. I find joy and fascination in learning new technologies. During my free time, I watch videos and read about the latest technological trends that emerge every day.
